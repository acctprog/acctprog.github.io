81. Assume that a 10-year Treasury bond has a 12% annual coupon, while a 15-year T-bond has an 8% annual coupon. Assume also that the yield curve is flat, and all Treasury securities have a 10% yield to maturity. Which of the following statements is correct?
 	a. 	If interest rates decline, the prices of both bonds will increase, but the 15-year bond would have a larger percentage increase in price.
 	b. 	If interest rates decline, the prices of both bonds will increase, but the 10-year bond would have a larger percentage increase in price.
 	c. 	The 10-year bond would sell at a discount, while the 15-year bond would sell at a premium.
 	d. 	The 10-year bond would sell at a premium, while the 15-year bond would sell at par.
ANSWER:  	a
RATIONALE:  	​
We can tell by inspection that (c) and (d) are incorrect. That leaves (a) and (b) as the only possibly correct statements. Also, recognize that longer-term bonds, and ones where payments come late (like low coupon bonds) are most sensitive to changes in interest rates. Thus, the 15-year, 8% coupon bond should be more sensitive to a decline in rates. Finally, we can do some calculations to confirm that (a) is the correct answer:
                                      Current situation              Rates decline    
10-year                        15-year      10-year      15-year
